## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug? Did you add a new feature or updated an existing one?** :gear:

* Create a [new fork](https://github.com/fabrisodotps1/M365PSProfile/fork) with all branches.

* Create a new branch based on the develop branch in the forked repository, where you implement your changes.

* Open a new pull request from the new branch to the develop branch of the original repository (all changes for the next release are added to the develop branch).

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.

## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?** :ring:
